# Exploratory Data Analysis Template using Python

## Introduction
This is a template for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it helps you understand the structure and characteristics of your dataset. This template provides a set of pre-defined procedures that you can follow for EDA. However, you'll need to provide your own inputs, such as the CSV file name, file path, and specific values.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed in your device.
- Jupyter Notebook or any preferred code editor. (I have used VS Code for this)
- Install all the Libraries used in the project using pip/ pip3 install command

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chirag529/EDA_Template.git
  ```
